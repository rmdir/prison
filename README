# mod_prison : FreeBSD only module for Apache 2.4 http server (and maybe 2.2) #

Unlike jail-patch, this module create an unique jail for all 
Apache childs. Main process still unjailed like with mod_unixd 
sothat you don't need anything except Documents inside the jail.

## Install ##

You need a FreeBSD version that supports libjail (> 7.2).
ldconfig -r | grep jail

Then you can do 

```make install```

You can specify apxs PATH when building

```make APXS=/usr/local/httpd/bin/apxs install```

You can enforce security settings via setting JAIL_PARANOID

```make -DJAIL_PARANOID install```

## Usage ##

Now you can set in global config :

_JailDir_ : the directory we will be jailed on
DocumentRoot must be relative to this path so you must use ```httpd -T``` 
to start Apache. If JAIL_PARANOID is set at compile time, JailDir must be
owned by root and not be world or group writable.

_JailIP_  : A single ipv4 or ipv6 string repersentation.
If JAIL_PARANOID is set you can't use INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0).

_JailSecurity_ : None|ALL|IPC

None : security settings are inherit from the system.
ALL : 
- securelevel : 3
- enforce_statfs : 2
- allow.set_hostname : 0
- allow.raw_sockets : 0
- allow.chflags : 0
- allow.mount : 0
- allow.quotas : 0
- allow.socket_af : 0
- allow.sysvipc : 0
IPC : like all but allow.sysvipc is set.

## Bugs and status ##

This is a really alpha software. It brakes graceful restart (```httpd -k graceful```)
